## Model Overview
In this repository, I have fit a multi-level linear model to predict spinal cord injury (SCI) patient recovery.

## SCI Background
Spinal cord injuries can be an extremely serious condition where the spinal cord is damaged and has a decreased ability to send and recieve nerve signals. Symptoms can include: 

- Paralysis
- Pain or pressure in head, neck, or back 
- Weakness and/or inability to move any part of the body 
- Difficulty breathing (Mayo Clinic, 2021)
