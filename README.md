# Rehabilitation from Spinal Cord Injuries
## Model Overview
In this repository, I have fit a multi-level linear model to predict spinal cord injury (SCI) patient recovery. Variables I considered include sex, height and weight at time of admission to rehabilitation, race, age at injury, traumatic etiology, neurologic level of injury, vertebral injury, spinal surgery, use of mechanical ventilation, ASIA motor score, and ASIA sensory scores.

## SCI Background
Spinal cord injuries can be an extremely serious condition where the spinal cord is damaged and has a decreased ability to send and recieve nerve signals. Symptoms can include: 

- Paralysis
- Pain or pressure in head, neck, or back 
- Weakness and/or inability to move any part of the body 
- Difficulty breathing (Mayo Clinic, 2021)
